# welch-neural-net
An intro to neural networks following the series at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs. In this project a small network with 6 nodes and one hidden layer is constructed. The gradient of the cost function with respect to the synapse weights is computed analytically. 
The network is trained using batch gradient descent, calling the BFGS algorithm from the Scipy library.

## Usage
Run the file 'testscores.py'
